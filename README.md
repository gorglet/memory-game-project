## Project Preview
This project is a website consisting of a Memory Game, built for a Udacity Course. The player clicks on and matches cards until all cards are matched.

## Getting Started
Run this project by cloning from github: https://github.com/gorglet/memory-game-project

## Instructions
* The player clicks on any card to start the game.
* The player clicks on any other card in the deck. If the two cards match, they will stay visible. If they do not match, they 'flip' back over.
* Play continues with player clicking on two cards to see if they match, until all cards match.
* Once the player has won the game (by matching all the cards), a modal pops up with the stats for the game.

## Game Features
* **Deck of Cards**: The game consists of a deck of cards, which gets shuffled on loading the site, and on restarting the game.

* **Timer**: There is a stopwatch feature to track the time it takes for the player to complete the game.

* **Move counter**: The move counter counts how many moves the player makes. A move is counted as two cards clicked.

* **Star rating**: The star rating decreases according to the number of moves taken, from a maximum of 5 stars down to a minimum of 1 star.

* **Restart button**: There is a restart button to allow the player to reset the game and start again, at any point during the game.
